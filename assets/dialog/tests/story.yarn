It is a dark and stormy night in the rough seas.
A crew of two attempts a time jump in their time-traveling ship.
Navigator: The quantum fluctuations are intensifying. We need to jump now.
Captain: But the calculations aren't complete. We could end up anywhere.
Navigator: The wormhole is collapsing. It's now or never.
Captain: Fine. Initiate jump sequence.
Navigator: Something's wrong. We're being pulled backward...
Captain: That's impossible. Unless...
Navigator: We're arriving before we left. We've become our own rescue mission.
