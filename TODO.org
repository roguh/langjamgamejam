* this evening
- DONE transcribe lore
- test tooling: node selector UI
- test tooling: variable viewer/setter UI
- test: skip blank lines
- test: linegroup
- sprite: ship internals

* friday
playable game
dialogue in game
controller
stretch: enemies
stretch: yarn stress test, fibonacci, fft

* later
pause on commas
animated exclamation mark
wavy animated text, animated ...













* test programs
- TODO find a good reference Scheme interpreter

* nice-to-have features for the new language:
- LSP: language server protocol for autocompletions and syntax
- sourcemap for nice error messages that link JS source code to original Scheme source code
- external JS minification and optimization tool

* developer experience
- haskell-language-server: autocompletions for ur editor
- code format with ormolu

* syntax based on R5Rs
- identifiers are case insensitive
- character escape code
- semicolon comment ;
- block comment #| |#
- R5Rs 2.3 justifies my wacky dictionary syntax!
    "[ ] { } | Left and right square brackets and curly braces
    and vertical bar are reserved for possible future exten-
    sions to the language."
- R7Rs-small might be cool!
    - unicode identifiers

* features
** very nice to have for the hackathon:
- allow read/code-as-data
    - store lisp representation within each object?
    - (read '(a b (+ 2 3))) -> "LispCode('(a b (+ 2 3))')"
- closures
    - should be straightforward because javascript supports closures
- continuations (how t.f. to implement in javascript?)
- macros (at least simple ones)
    - idea for game: inline level-definition via macro
- backquote, comma, comma-ampersand
    - reminds me of string interpolation?

** easy?
- define, set!
    - (define (variable . formal) body)
- begin sequencing, top-level is a giant (begin)
- delay/force for lazy programming
- proper atoms
- do
- for-each
- extended dictionary support, more lisp-like (make-dict) (union)
- repl
    - rlwrap, node wrapper

** less easy
- a complete number pyramid including rationals and complex numbers in javascript
    - javascript how omg
- cond: compile efficiently if possible
- proper lists, an linked list with car and cdr fields
    - allows for IMPROPER lists
    - implement the dot operator (h . t)
- eval
    - scheme in JS
    - limited support?
- good error messages?
    - at least show the location of the error nicely
